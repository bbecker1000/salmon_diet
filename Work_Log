To-do:
- Apply frequency occurence analysis (convert all counts to 1/0)

Ellington applied separate life stage plots and PERMANOVA analysis for SH

Ellington removed unknown diet items from data (following Ruby's selection 
criteria) and applied manyglm framework to identify significant differences
and estimators

Ellington partitioned prey taxa into aquatic and terrestrial types for spatial
analysis

2/11/26

To-do:
- Separate life stages for SH (DONE)
- Take out unknown diet items from data (DONE)

Maggie plotted percentage diet composition across species

Maggie and Ellington tested PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis matrix, found similar outcomes to NMDS Adonis

Maggie and Ellington tested Morisita-Horn Index and found CH-CO have 0.98 diet similiarity, 
but CH-SH and CO-SH have 0.60 and 0.64 similiarty respectively
^ Likely due to both lifestage and unknown prey items

Maggie and Ellington created GLM_test R script for tidying diet data for glm-application

To-do:
- Investigate Ruby's discussion of glvm?
- Apply USGS analysis

?

Maggie created Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) R script for granular data visualization of every DietData variable and NMDS of env.
