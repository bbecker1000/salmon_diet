Ellington processed Redwood BMI data and ran chi-sq analyses on community composition data compared to species diets
- Results: Significance across species diets compared to community composition
- Issues: 
    A) Community data was from 2020 whereas species data is from 2022
    B) Community data lacks terrestrial prey, which make up a significant chunk of species diet data
    C) There compared data only consisted of the 7 orders shared across both datasets
Maggie ran Elligton's chi-sq analysis but with only 2020 data 
Results: 
      - CO individual test p= 0.57, insignifiant 
      - SH individual test p= 0.0004998, significant 
More Issues/ Commments/ Questions: 
      A) No chinook data from 2020 so no statement on chinook preference can be made.. we might have to throw this question out tbh 
      B) Community data also lacks gastropoda data so can't use for invasive snail question.. (did snails invade in the last 6 years?)
      C) Where was each invert community sample taken on the creek? 
Maggie ran a series of GLMs for each species occurance with abiotic factors 
Results: 
  - SH dramtically associated with plunge pools and riffles (bigger?)
  - CO dramtically disassociated with plunge pools, riffles, poolcomplexity=1, and LWD. 
  - CH dramatically disassociated with plunge pools and riffles
Maggie ran PERMANOVA on abotic factors signficance on diet composition 
Results: 
  - Species is still biggest sig and r2 
  - Habitat type, pool surface area, percent cover, and small wood debris presence also signficant. still 0.817 residual though. 
Further Questions: 
  - are wood debris types more associated with areas of the creek on a local scale? 
  - difference in wood debris types associated with differential foraging strategies? 
  - Need to break down SH into ages .. if no different :could CH disporportionately effect CO given SH exploits different areas of the stream, and CO already not doing well comparatively?

Maggie loaded Darren Data and proofed old Ruby code 
- How to deal with GIS data in here/ at all? I'm inexerienced in that.. didn't load those files

To-do:
- Apply frequency occurence analysis (convert all counts to 1/0)
- Literature review on specific habitat (river) characteristics and at
sampling points
- Investigate Levin's B Index for dietary niche width?

Ellington applied separate life stage plots and PERMANOVA analysis for SH

Ellington removed unknown diet items from data (following Ruby's selection 
criteria) and applied manyglm framework to identify significant differences
and estimators

Ellington partitioned prey taxa into aquatic and terrestrial types for spatial
analysis

2/11/26

To-do:
- Separate life stages for SH (DONE)
- Take out unknown diet items from data (DONE)

Maggie plotted percentage diet composition across species

Maggie and Ellington tested PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis matrix, found similar outcomes to NMDS Adonis

Maggie and Ellington tested Morisita-Horn Index and found CH-CO have 0.98 diet similiarity, 
but CH-SH and CO-SH have 0.60 and 0.64 similiarty respectively
^ Likely due to both lifestage and unknown prey items

Maggie and Ellington created GLM_test R script for tidying diet data for glm-application

To-do:
- Investigate Ruby's discussion of glvm?
- Apply USGS analysis

?

Maggie created Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) R script for granular data visualization of every DietData variable and NMDS of env.
